# HPC GPU Programming with NVIDIA CUDA

Here are some of the examples of my high performance computing practice with _CUDA_. Every folder contains different problem. The code consist of both _NVIDIA CUDA_ GPU implementation and sequential implementation.

- **vector-add** - vector addition CUDA implementation and comparison with sequential program

- **vector-add-streams** - also vector addition but with CUDA streams usage implementation

- **vector-transform** - vector transform CUDA implementation and comparison with sequential program

- **crypto** - cryptography example, single key and multi key Caesar-code implementation with CUDA

- **conv** - matrix convolution example with CUDA GPU programming
